# ReactFusion/Rusion
Basically just a fork of [Fusion](https://github.com/dphfox/Fusion) that has a bunch of [Roact](https://github.com/Roblox/roact) features spliced into it. <br/>
*(This is not meant to be used for production, its more of a project to help me understand Fusion)*

## Contributions
All contributions are welcome! <br/>
If someone would like to make this type-safe I would really appreciate that, I have no idea how to use types in Luau...
