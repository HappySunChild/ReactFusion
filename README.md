# ReactFusion/Rusion
Basically just a fork of [Fusion](https://github.com/dphfox/Fusion) that has a bunch of [Roact](https://github.com/Roblox/roact) features spliced into it. <br/>
*(This is not meant to be used for production, its more of a project to help me understand Fusion)*

Archiving this repo because I just thought about removing all of the Roact stuff and just making this a fork of Fusion since I'm more accustomed to it now.
